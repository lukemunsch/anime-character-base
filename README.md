## Overview

Luke's Animé Character Base is a site that will allow the Owner of the site to manage their favourite characters from their favourite animé shows.

The owner of the site can create a series and then list their favourite characters. Users will then be able to rate their favourite characters and leave comments on them for the Owner to review.

If a character that the users like doesn't appear on the site, then they can send a suggestion to the Owner and other people can see the suggestions too.
